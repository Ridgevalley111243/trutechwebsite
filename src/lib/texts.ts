const TERMS = `These terms apply when you use this website or hire {brand} (“we”, “us”) for websites, web applications, management systems, graphic design, IT support or training. By using the website or accepting a quote, you agree to them. Anything we agree with you in writing for a specific project, including by WhatsApp or email, takes priority over these terms.

## 1. Projects and quotes

- Before we start, we agree the scope, price and timeline of the project in writing.
- Quotes are valid for 14 days unless they say otherwise.
- Work outside the agreed scope is quoted and charged separately.

## 2. Payment

- Unless we agree otherwise, a 50% deposit is due before work begins and the balance before final files are released or a site or system goes live.
- Payments are in Ghana cedis by mobile money, bank transfer or an online payment link.
- Fees for third-party services (domains, hosting, paid plugins, SMS or payment providers) are paid by you unless the quote includes them.

## 3. Your part

- You provide the content, information and approvals we need, on time.
- You confirm you have the right to use any logos, photos, text or data you give us.
- Delays in providing content or feedback may move the delivery date.

## 4. Reviews, revisions and approval

- We share drafts through a private link where you can view the work, request changes or approve it.
- Each project includes two rounds of revisions unless we agree otherwise; further changes are charged.
- Approving the work through your private link, WhatsApp or email confirms that it’s accepted.

## 5. Private links and files

- Your private link is for you and your team. Please don’t share it publicly; anyone with the link can open it.
- Files marked view only are for review. They may not be downloaded, copied, screenshotted or used until the work is approved and paid for.
- Links may be switched off or set to expire. Please download your final files when you receive them; we keep them for a limited time (see our [Privacy Policy]({base}privacy/)).

## 6. Ownership

- When the project is paid in full, you own the final approved deliverables made for you.
- We keep ownership of drafts and unused concepts, and of our own tools, templates and reusable code, which we license to you for use in your project.
- Fonts, stock images, plugins and other third-party materials stay under their own licences.

## 7. Our portfolio

We may show completed work in our portfolio and on social media, unless you ask us in writing not to. We never show confidential information, private data or work that isn’t public yet.

## 8. Support

For websites and systems, we fix bugs in the work we delivered free of charge for 30 days after launch. Ongoing maintenance, hosting management and new features are available by separate agreement.

## 9. Cancellation

Either of us can end a project by telling the other in writing. The deposit isn’t refundable once work has started, and work completed up to the cancellation is charged.

## 10. Liability

We do our work with reasonable care and skill. We aren’t responsible for problems caused by third-party services (such as hosting, payment providers or APIs), by changes made by others, or for indirect losses such as lost profits. Our total liability for a project is limited to the amount you paid for it.

## 11. This website

The text, designs and images on this website belong to {brand} or to the clients they were made for. You may not copy or reuse them without permission, or use the website in a way that harms it or others.

## 12. Law and changes

These terms are governed by the laws of Ghana. We may update them; the version on this page at the time you accept a quote applies to that project.

## Contact

Questions about these terms? Contact us at {email}.`;

const PRIVACY = `This policy explains what personal information {brand} (“we”, “us”) collects when you use this website or work with us, why we collect it, and the choices you have. We handle personal information in line with Ghana’s Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843).

## Who we are

{brand} is a technology and design business based in {location}. You can reach us at {email} or {phone}.

## Browsing this website

- The website has no user accounts, advertising or analytics trackers, and it doesn’t set cookies.
- If you switch between light and dark mode, your choice is saved in your own browser only.
- Like any website, the services that deliver it receive technical information such as your IP address and browser type: GitHub Pages (hosting) and Supabase (portfolio content and images). Fonts are served from this website, not from a third party.

## When you contact us

The contact form doesn’t store anything on this website. It opens WhatsApp or your email app with your message ready to send, so we receive only what you choose to send: usually your name, contact details and project details. WhatsApp and your email provider handle your message under their own privacy policies.

## When you’re our client

To deliver and review your work, we keep:

- your name, and your WhatsApp number if you give it to us;
- the project title, our messages to you and the files we prepare for you;
- the feedback, approvals and ratings you send through your private link;
- when your private link was first opened.

This information is stored with Supabase, our database and file storage provider, on servers in London, United Kingdom. Your files can only be opened through your private link, which we can switch off, replace or set to expire, and only the {brand} administrator can manage them.

## Why we use your information

- to reply to you and prepare quotes;
- to deliver, review and support the work you asked for;
- to keep business records such as approvals and payments;
- to show completed work in our portfolio, as described in our [Terms]({base}terms/).

We don’t sell personal information or use it for advertising.

## Who we share it with

Only the service providers that run this website and our work: Supabase (database and files), GitHub (website hosting) and WhatsApp or email when you use them to talk to us. We may also share information when the law requires it.

## How long we keep it

We keep client files for as long as we need them to deliver and support your project, usually up to 12 months after delivery, then delete them. We keep approvals, reviews and payment records as business records. You can ask us to delete your information sooner.

## Your rights

You can ask to see the personal information we hold about you, to correct it, or to delete it, and you can withdraw any consent you gave. Contact us using the details above. If you’re not satisfied with our answer, you can complain to the Data Protection Commission of Ghana.

## Children

Our services are for businesses, schools and adults. Work for schools is arranged with the school, not with students directly.

## Changes

If we change this policy, we’ll update it on this page and change the date at the top.`;
